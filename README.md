# mori - 杜

## Instllation

## Usage

## The Meaning Behind the Name "mori(杜)"
While "mori(杜)" literally means "a cluster of trees," in Japanese cultural context it most commonly refers to shrine forests—the sacred groves that surround shrine grounds. This has evolved to convey the idea of "forests as a sacred boundary or barrier."

*	Forests as sacred domains
  Shrine guardian forests are regarded as "natural boundaries" that separate the mundane world from the divine realm. The transition from the secular to the sacred is symbolized by crossing the torii gate into the forest.

*	Mori as symbolic barriers
  These aren't mere woodlands but "preserved spaces dedicated to divine worship." They represent sanctified areas isolated from the outside world.

We chose the name "mori(杜)" to evoke the image of a specially protected domain—a sandbox-like boundary shielded from the outside world.
